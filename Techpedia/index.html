                    What is JavaScript?
                </h3>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make 
                    webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, 
                    popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions 
                    of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality 
                    to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration 
                    between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, 
                    a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment 
                    to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
                    and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and 
                    statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    <ul class="main-list">
                        <li class="main-list-item">
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control 
                            a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions
                            allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user 
                            events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.  
                        </li>
                        <li class="main-list-item">
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
                            to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow 
                            an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information 
                            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations 
                            on a server. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, 
                    likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written 
                    in the browser.

                    JavaScript and Java
                </h3>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong 
                    type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic 
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports
                     a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and 
                     string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common 
                     class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is,
                     what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions 
                     without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing
                     as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, 
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, 
                    or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function 
                    return types are not explicitly typed.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type 
                    safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or 
                    access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs 
                    consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing 
                    generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming 
                    more complex than JavaScript programming.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages 
                    such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider 
                    audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal 
                    requirements for object creation.

                    based on JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves 
                    the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open 
                    standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard 
                    is documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about 
                    different versions of JavaScript and ECMAScript specification editions.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
                    as ISO-16262. You can also find the specification on the Ecma International website. 
                    The ECMAScript specification does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM), 
                    which is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or WHATWG 
                    (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). The DOM defines the 
                    way in which HTML document objects are exposed to your script. To get a better 
                    idea about the different technologies that are used when programming with JavaScript,

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript. It is useful 
                    if you want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation 
                    or engine (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).

                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers. Use the JavaScript documentation
                    for information when writing scripts.

                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript 
                    programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language 
                    itself remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.

                    Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some 
                    JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using 
                    the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.

                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a JavaScript 
                    interpreter that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    To open the Web Console (Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Option-K on Mac), open the Tools menu 
                    in Firefox, and select "Developer ▶ Web Console". 
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">         
                    The Web Console appears at the bottom of the browser window. Along the bottom of the console is an input
                     line that you can use to enter JavaScript, and the output appears in the panel above:
                </p>
                <div class="section-img-wrapper">
                    <img src="" alt="" class="section-img">
                </div>
                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake 
                    of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is 
                    actually surrounded by console.log around eval, like so:
                </p>

                    <code class="section-code">
<pre>
function greetMe(yourName) {

  alert("Hello " + yourName)

}

console.log(eval('3 + 5'))
</pre>

                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    The single-line input mode of the Web Console is great for quick testing of JavaScript 
                    expressions, but although you can execute multiple lines, it's not very convenient 
                    for that. For more complex JavaScript, you can use the multi-line line input mode.
                </p>

                <p class="section-paragraph"> 
                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write 
                    your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>

  greetMe('World');

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end 
                    of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:

                    JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by 
                    Awk, Perl, and Python.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh 
                    (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
                </p>
                <code class="section-code">
<pre>
let fruit = "Foobar"
</pre>                    
                </code>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    But, the variable <span class="gray-back">fruit</span> is not the same as Fruit because JavaScript is 
                    case sensitive.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    In JavaScript, instructions are called <a href="#">statements </a> and are separated by semicolons (;).
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more 
                    than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not 
                    strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.
                </p>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence 
                    of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. 
                    (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
                </p>
                <code class="section-code">
<pre class="gray-text">

                    X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps 
                    to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:
